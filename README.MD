<h1>GUIShop 4.1.6 E</h1>
I have been working on the plugin lately trying to implement a new selling system. All is looking good so far.
Due to a HDD failure i was rolled back a few days, But i have managed to find a copy i sent to someone
on Skype.

I have re added Shop signs.

Cleaned alot of code. Corrected some code.

BUGS:
For some reason when pressing back spits out the Back button onto the ground.
I am looking into this now.
